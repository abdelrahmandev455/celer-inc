# Celer

Celer is a technology company focused on developing cutting-edge solutions to help businesses succeed in today's fast-paced digital landscape. Our flagship product is a software solution that translates XML data into SQL queries, making it easy to query and analyze data stored in XML format.

In addition to our XML-to-SQL technology, we also utilize Redis, an in-memory data store, to speed up data sending and retrieval. Redis is a popular solution for caching data because it is lightning-fast and can handle large volumes of data. By using Redis, we can help businesses access their data quickly and efficiently, enabling them to make more informed decisions in real-time.
